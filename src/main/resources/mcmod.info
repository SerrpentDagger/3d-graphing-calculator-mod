  "description": "This mod provides numerous blocks which allow for the graphing of 3D functions. The graphs are highly customizable by the player, and with the correct settings can look very fine indeed. Graphs can be saved in-game for later viewing through the use of Graphing Calculator Memory Card items. Graphs can be scaled, translated, rotated, colored, and textured. You can alter their domain, range, resolution, discontinuity threshold, and texture size, among other things. Information about everything can be found within the calculator GUI, by hovering your mouse over the far right of a text field. Functions are inputted via an easy-to-use set of GUI blocks, as shown in the images tab (As of the first release version).

 

Here is a list of all the coordinate systems currently supported. With each of them, save for Cartesian*, you can view any variable as a function of the other two.
*Spoiler, it looks the same.

 

- Cartesian
- Spherical
- Cylindrical
- Conical
- Toroidal
- Bipolar Cylindrical
- Parabolic Cylindrical
- Parabolic
- 6-Sphere
- Oblate Spheroidal
- Prolate Spheroidal
- Elliptic Cylindrical
